# u-develop-it

## Functionality
U-Develop-It is a mock voting app created by "developers" for "developers". For this project, the task at hand was to develop a database with various tables for candidates, voters and votes all with their respective data. Each table was created using CRUD operations and each joined together relationally, based on their id's. 
Using Node.js a connection was made to the MySQL database. Through this, SQL queries from within Express.js routes were executed. Each route was tested using Insomnia.
